 Creating a data entry application to store marks if students using tkinter and sqlite


the following is the instruction provided to me for building the  application.
A.	Create a GUI Application for student marks insertion and CGPA calculation


1. Create a tkinter based application consisting of a login page(Graphical User Interface) where you have two input ‘’User Name “ and “password ” and a submit button. On providing correct input and on clicking the submit button a new GUI (1) will open and on wrong input an error message box should pop up having the content “ Invalid username or password ”.

2 . The GUI (1) should consist of three inputs “ Name ” , ”Branch ” and “Registration ID ” followed by a submit button. On clicking the submit button the data entered should be stored in a database (Using Mysql or Sqlite) and should also open another user interface GUI (2) . 

3. The GUI (2) should consist of minimum  of three buttons consisting of  subjects name (of your choice ) and on submit button . On clicking any of the subject button  an input user interface should appear where the user can input the marks . On clicking the submit button, the marks entered should get saved in the database on the same row of the  ‘username’ and ‘registration number’ entered earlier and  a new GUI(3) opens .
4.The GUI(3) should consist of four buttons “ CGPA” , “GRADE” , “New Input” and “ Close”.
On clicking  ,
The CGPA button should show the CGPA(on the range of 10) based on the marks input.
The GRADE button should show the grade of the student (Ex: CGPA=10,Grade=O) 
The New Input button should reopen the GUI(1) and the process of insertion should continue.
The Close button should close all the existing GUIs.

Apart from this instructions when you onpen the application you will find some features which I addded apart from the instructions which I think were necessary for the proper working of the application and fulfilling its use like:

1.> The create account window.
2.> The entries display window (you willl find it in).
3.> The dazzling welcome screen (I did it just to satisfy myself  :-P)
and my personal favourite,
4.> The promotion window where I have given SPECTRUM CLUB'S website link and my GitHub Handle.If you find an 'i' button anywhere just click it please. Do follow me on GitHub. Here's the link:
